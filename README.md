# ðŸ©º Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning
Stroke Prediction using ML classifiers with preprocessing, EDA, and model comparison (LogReg, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree).

This project predicts the likelihood of a **stroke** based on healthcare attributes such as age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, and glucose levels.  
It compares multiple machine learning classifiers and evaluates their performance on a medical dataset.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, label encoding, feature engineering)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (correlation, distributions, heatmaps)
- Classification using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Model evaluation using **Accuracy, F1 Score, MAE, MSE, Log Loss**
- Visualization of model results and comparisons

## ðŸ“Š Results
- **Logistic Regression / SVM / KNN** â†’ ~93.8% accuracy  
- **Decision Tree** â†’ ~91.8% accuracy  
- Insights:
  - Age, hypertension, and heart disease strongly influence stroke risk.
  - Peculiar trends observed: non-smokers showing higher stroke probability than smokers (worth further study).  
  - BMI between 20â€“50 linked to higher risk.
